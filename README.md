<details><summary><H3>Summary of Part 1 </H3></summary>

<details><summary><H4>Purpose</H4></summary>

This Verilog module serves as an RGB LED controller, integrating an internal oscillator and a frequency counter to facilitate precise management of RGB LED outputs. By providing a stable internal clock source, the module ensures reliable timing for LED operations while incorporating a dedicated test signal for external monitoring. This design is particularly well-suited for embedded systems that require consistent LED performance with minimal reliance on external components.








</details>

<details><summary><H4>Internal Logic and Oscillator</summary>

At the heart of the module is a high-frequency oscillator (SB_HFOSC), which acts as the internal timing source. The output from this oscillator drives a 28-bit frequency counter that increments with each clock cycle. This counter not only tracks timing information but also outputs its 5th bit to the ` testwire ` , enabling external observation of the counter's state. This setup allows for effective monitoring and debugging of the module's timing behavior.




</details>

<details><summary><H4>RGB Led Driver Functionality</summary>


The RGB LED driver (SB_RGBA_DRV) is responsible for controlling the LED outputs with the following key features:

### Current-Controlled Outputs

<p>Each color channel is configured with a minimum current setting of "0b000001," ensuring proper brightness levels.</p>


### Pulse Width Modulation

The driver utilizes PWM control for each color channel, allowing for dynamic adjustments in brightness and color mixing.



### Fixed Configuration

- The blue LED is configured to operate at maximum brightness (RGB2PWM = 1'b1), providing a vibrant blue output.
+ The red and green LEDs are set to minimum brightness (RGB0PWM = RGB1PWM = 1'b0), effectively turning them off.

#### This configuration enables the module to deliver precise control over the RGB LED's color output, ensuring stable operation while facilitating easy testing and monitoring capabilities.

### The PCF file consists of pin assignments that specify the following:


### Pin Name

<p>The name of the physical pin on the FPGA</p>



### Signal Name

**The corresponding signal from the Verilog code.**





### Direction

Indicates whether the pin is an input or output.



















</details>

<details><summary><H4>Pin Assignments explained</summary>

**Each line in the PCF file corresponds to a specific pin assignment:** 


## set_io led_red 39

This line assigns the `led_red` output from the Verilog module to physical pin 39 on the FPGA. The ability to control the red LED is essential for color mixing in the RGB LED. By adjusting the PWM signal for this pin, the brightness of the red light can be varied, allowing for a wide range of colors when combined with green and blue.




## set_io led_blue 40
This line assigns the `led_blue` output to pin 40. Similar to the red LED, the blue LED's brightness is controlled via PWM. This pin is crucial for producing colors that require blue light, such as purple when mixed with red or cyan when mixed with green.



## set_io led_green 41

This line assigns the `led_green` output to pin 41. The green LED is vital for creating a full spectrum of colors. By varying the PWM signal on this pin, the intensity of the green light can be adjusted, enabling the creation of colors like yellow (when mixed with red) and white (when all colors are combined).


## set_io hw_clk 20
This line assigns the `hw_clk input` to pin 20. Provides the clock signal for synchronization. The clock signal is fundamental for the operation of digital circuits. It ensures that all components of the Verilog module operate in sync, particularly the frequency counter that drives the timing for the RGB LED driver.


## set_io testwire 17


This line assigns the `testwire output` to pin 17. This pin is important for debugging and verifying the functionality of the design. By monitoring the state of the testwire, developers can ensure that the internal oscillator and frequency counter are working correctly, which is critical for the overall performance of the RGB LED controller.

<details><summary><H2>Objective</H2></summary>

The objective of this task is to implement a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) loopback mechanism. This mechanism allows transmitted data to be immediately received back, facilitating the testing of UART functionality. By routing the transmitted data from the TX (Transmit) pin directly to the RX (Receive) pin, we can verify that the UART communication is functioning correctly without the need for external devices.



</details>

<details><summary><H2>Step 1 : Study the Existing Code</summary>

### UART is a widely used hardware communication protocol that enables serial communication between devices. It operates using two primary data lines:

- **TX(Transmit)** - The line used to send data from the device.
+ **RX(Recieve)**  - The line used to receive data into the device.

## Understanding the UART Loopback Mechanism

<p> A UART loopback mechanism is a diagnostic feature that allows the system to test its own communication capabilities. In this mode, any data sent to the TX pin is routed back to the RX pin of the same module. This setup is particularly useful for verifying that both the TX and RX lines are functioning correctly.</p>


## Existing Code:  
<p>The code for the UART loopback mechanism can be found in the repository <a href="https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/tree/main/uart_loopback">here</a>. This code includes the necessary Verilog modules to implement the UART protocol and the loopback functionality.</p>


<details><summary><H3>Analysis of the Existing code</H3></summary>


 The existing code for the UART loopback mechanism is designed to facilitate serial communication between the FPGA and external devices. It consists of two main components: the top module and the UART transmission module. Below is a detailed analysis of each component.


## 1. Top Module (top.v)

### The top module integrates the UART functionality and controls the RGB LEDs. Key features include:

- Module Declaration:

       module top (
        output wire led_red,   // Red LED output
        output wire led_blue,  // Blue LED output
        output wire led_green, // Green LED output
        output wire uarttx,    // UART Transmission pin
        input wire uartrx,     // UART Reception pin
        input wire hw_clk      // Hardware clock input
       );

     - This section declares the inputs and outputs of the top module. The `uart tx` pin is used for transmitting data, while the uartrx pin is used for receiving data. The RGB LEDs provide visual feedback based on the UART activity.

+ Internal Oscillator

The internal oscillator generates the clock signal for UART operation:

    SB_HFOSC #(.CLKHF_DIV ("0b10")) u_SB_HFOSC ( .CLKHFPU(1'b1), .CLKHFEN(1'b1), .CLKHF(int_osc

**This oscillator is configured to run at a specific frequency, which is essential for timing the UART communication.**..

* Loopback Logic:

The TX output is connected to the RX input, enabling loopback:

    assign uarttx = uartrx;


- RGB LED Control:

The RGB LED driver provides visual feedback based on the RX data:

     SB_RGBA_DRV RGB_DRIVER (
       .RGBLEDEN(1'b1),
       .RGB0PWM(uartrx),
       .RGB1PWM(uartrx),
       .RGB2PWM(uartrx),
       .CURREN(1'b1),
       .RGB0(led_green),
       .RGB1(led_blue),
       .RGB2(led_red)
     );


## 2. . UART Transmission Module (`uart_tx_8n1.v`)

This module handles the transmission of data over UART using the 8N1 format.

- Module Declaration:

      module uart_tx_8n1 (
          clk,        // input clock
          txbyte,     // outgoing byte
          senddata,   // trigger tx
          txdone,     // outgoing byte sent
          tx          // tx wire
      );

+ State Machine:

The module uses a state machine to manage the transmission process:

     parameter STATE_IDLE=8'd0;
     parameter STATE_STARTTX=8'd1;
     parameter STATE_TXING=8'd2;
     parameter STATE_TXDONE=8'd3;


* Transmission Logic:

The logic for sending data is implemented in an always block that triggers on the clock's rising edge:

     always @ (posedge clk) begin
         // Start sending?
         if (senddata == 1 && state == STATE_IDLE) begin
             state <= STATE_STARTTX;
             buf_tx <= txbyte;
             txdone <= 1'b0;
         end
         // Additional logic for sending bits...
     end

## How to create Block Diagram ?🤔🤔

Block Diagrams are specific diagrams used to represent a flow or structure in an easy way..

Hints for creating the block diagram!!😣

- The internal oscillator (SB_HFOSC) implements a high - frequency oscillator.
     - Also generates internal clock signal(int_osc)
     - **Basically this means that the internal clock signal(int_osc) will be a high frequency oscillator.**
+ Also there is a 28 bit frequency counter(frequency_counter_i) which implements on every positive edge of internal oscillator(int_osc)
* The TX and RX {Transmit and Recieve} pins are connected directly with loopback.
* The RGB LED Driver {SB_RGBA_DRV} controls the three ports or channels :- led_red, led_blue, and led_green.
* Control Signals include RGB_LEDEN and Curren.

### With the help of the following hints, our Block Diagram will look as :-

# Summary of the Report

## Objective

<p>The main goal of this project was to set up and test a Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) loopback system using an FPGA board. In this setup, data that is sent out is immediately received back, making it a useful way to check if UART communication is working properly. The project involved learning the theory, designing the system, building the hardware, and testing the UART loopback function on the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini.</p>

<details><summary><H3>Step 1 : Study the existing code</H3></summary>

**Conceptual Framework**: UART is a fundamental serial communication protocol employing distinct TX (Transmit) and RX (Receive) channels for bidirectional data transmission.

**Loopback Mechanism**: The implementation of a loopback entails directly connecting the TX and RX pins, thereby enabling autonomous communication testing.

**Code Analysis**:

- **Top Module (top.v)**: Governs UART operations and LED-based visual feedback.

+ **Internal Oscillator (int_osc)**: Synthesizes high-frequency clock signals essential for timing control.

* **Loopback Logic**: Implements a direct assignment of TX to RX to establish the loopback mechanism.

## Objective

<p>The purpose of this project is to develop and validate a UART transmitter module using an FPGA. This module enables serial communication by sending data from the FPGA to an external device, such as a computer or another microcontroller, through the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) protocol.

## Understanding Uart Transmission

UART is a widely used serial communication protocol that enables data exchange between devices. The protocol consists of two main lines:

- Tx(Transmit): Sends data from the transmitting device.
+ Rx(Recieve): Recieves data at the recieving device.

### Data Frame in UART(8N1 Configuration)

- **Each byte of data is transmitted in the 8N1 format, meaning:**
      + Data Bits
* No Parity Bit
* 1 Stop Bit

A typical UART data frame consists of:

1. Start Bit (1 bit, Low)

2. Data Bits (8 bits, Least Significant Bit first)

3. Stop Bit (1 bit, High)

The baud rate (speed of transmission) for this project is 9600 bps.






<details><summary><H2>Step 1 : Study the Existing Code</H2></summary>



## **`top.v` (Top-Level Module)**

This file acts as the main control module, integrating various components of the UART transmitter.

### **Module Declaration**

```verilog
module top (
  output wire led_red,  // Red LED Output
  output wire led_blue, // Blue LED Output
  output wire led_green, // Green LED Output
  output wire uarttx, // UART Transmission Pin
  input wire hw_clk  // FPGA Clock Input
);
```

- **`led_red, led_blue, led_green`** – Indicate the system’s status.
- **`uarttx`** – Transmit pin for sending serial data.
- **`hw_clk`** – Hardware clock input for timing control.

### **Clock Frequency Counter**

```verilog
reg [27:0] frequency_counter_i;
reg clk_9600 = 0;
reg [31:0] cntr_9600 = 32'b0;
parameter period_9600 = 625;
```

- **`frequency_counter_i`** – 28-bit counter for timing operations.
- **`clk_9600`** – Generated clock signal for UART (9600 Hz).
- **`cntr_9600`** – Counter to achieve the correct baud rate.
- **`period_9600`** – Determines when to toggle `clk_9600`.

### **UART Transmission Instantiation**

```verilog
uart_tx_8n1 DanUART (
  .clk(clk_9600),
  .txbyte("D"),
  .senddata(frequency_counter_i[24]),
  .tx(uarttx)
);
```

- **`clk(clk_9600)`** – Supplies the 9600 Hz clock.
- **`txbyte("D")`** – Sends the character `'D'` continuously.
- **`senddata(frequency_counter_i[24])`** – Controls when data is sent.
- **`tx(uarttx)`** – Connects to the UART TX pin.

### **Clock Division for 9600 Baud Rate**

```verilog
always @(posedge int_osc) begin
  frequency_counter_i <= frequency_counter_i + 1'b1;
  cntr_9600 <= cntr_9600 + 1;
  if (cntr_9600 == period_9600) begin
    clk_9600 <= ~clk_9600;
    cntr_9600 <= 32'b0;
  end
end
```

- This logic ensures **clk_9600 toggles** at the correct rate for UART transmission.

---

## **`uart_trx.v` (UART Transmission Logic)**

This module implements the **8N1 UART transmission protocol**.

### **State Machine for Transmission**

```verilog
parameter STATE_IDLE=8'd0;
parameter STATE_STARTTX=8'd1;
parameter STATE_TXING=8'd2;
parameter STATE_TXDONE=8'd3;
```

- Defines **four states** for handling transmission.

### **Transmission Control Logic**

```verilog
always @ (posedge clk) begin
  if (senddata == 1 && state == STATE_IDLE) begin
    state <= STATE_STARTTX;
    buf_tx <= txbyte;
    txdone <= 1'b0;
  end
  else if (state == STATE_IDLE) begin
    txbit <= 1'b1;
    txdone <= 1'b0;
  end
```

- On `senddata` trigger, the system moves to **STATE_STARTTX**.
- It loads the byte to be transmitted (`buf_tx`).

### **Sending Start Bit (Low)**

```verilog
if (state == STATE_STARTTX) begin
  txbit <= 1'b0;
  state <= STATE_TXING;
end
```

- The start bit (`0`) is sent.

### **Transmitting 8 Data Bits**

```verilog
if (state == STATE_TXING && bits_sent < 8'd8) begin
  txbit <= buf_tx[0];
  buf_tx <= buf_tx>>1;
  bits_sent = bits_sent + 1;
end
```

- Bits are shifted **one by one** into `txbit`.

### **Stop Bit and Completion**

```verilog
else if (state == STATE_TXING) begin
  txbit <= 1'b1;
  bits_sent <= 8'b0;
  state <= STATE_TXDONE;
end
if (state == STATE_TXDONE) begin
  txdone <= 1'b1;
  state <= STATE_IDLE;
end
```

- Sends the **stop bit (`1`)**.
- **Returns to IDLE state** after completion.

## 1. Identify the Key Components

Every UART transmitter has these core blocks:

## UART Transmitter Block Components

This table summarizes the key components of the UART transmitter module:

| Section             | Function                                    | Example Variable Names (Verilog) |

## UART Basics

- UART consists of two main lines.
      - **TX(Transmit)**: Sends Data
      - **RX(Recieve)**: Recieves Data
+ 8N1 Data Frame Format:-
     - 1 Start Bit (Low)
     - 8 Data Bits
     - 1 Stop Bit (High)
     - Baud Rate: 9600 bps

 ##  Code Analysis

 - **top.v** (Top-Level Module):
     - Controls the Entire UART Transmission process.
     - Key Variables: `uarttx` (TX Pin), `hw_clk` (Clock), `led_red/blue/green` (Status LED's).
     - Implements clock division to generate a 9600 Hz clock signal for UART.
- **uart_trx.v** (UART Transmission Logic):
     - Implements a FSM(Finite State Machine) with four states:
          1. IDLE: Waits for Transmission Trigger
          2. STARTTX: Sends the start bit (0)
          3. TXING: Sends 8 data bits
          4. TXDONE: Sends the stop bit(1) and returns to IDLE
     - Uses bitwise shifts to transmit the data serially.

<details><summary><H1>Task 4</H1></summary>

# Objective

The goal of this project is to implement a UART transmitter that communicates real-time sensor data from an FPGA to an external device. This enables the FPGA to relay information gathered from sensors, facilitating data monitoring and analysis.

# Understading UART Transmission

### UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is a serial communication protocol that allows for asynchronous data transmission between devices. It operates using two primary lines:

- **Tx (Transmit)**: The line used to send data from the transmitter.
+ **Rx (Receive)**: The line used to receive data at the receiving end.
 # Data Frame Structure in UART (8N1 Configuration)
### In the 8N1 configuration, each data byte is structured as follows:

- **Start Bit**: 1 bit (Low) indicating the beginning of transmission.
+ **Data Bits**: 8 bits of actual data, sent least significant bit first.
* **Stop Bit**: 1 bit (High) indicating the end of transmission.

> The standard baud rate for this project is set to 9600 bps.

<details><summary><h2>Step 1: Study the Existing Code</h2></summary>

## **`top.v`(Top Level Module)**

This module integrates the sensor input and the UART transmitter, managing the flow of data from the sensor to the UART output.

### Module Declaration

     module top (
       output wire led_status, // Status LED Output
       output wire uart_tx,    // UART Transmission Pin
       input wire hw_clk,      // FPGA Clock Input
       input wire sensor_input  // Sensor Data Input
     );


- `led_status`: Indicates the operational status of the system.
- `uart_tx`: The pin used for UART transmission.
- `hw_clk`: The clock signal for the FPGA.
- `sensor_input`: The data input from the sensor.

reg [7:0] sensor_data; // Register to hold the sensor data

### Sensor Data Handling

- `sensor_data`: Stores the latest reading from the sensor.

### UART Transmission Instantiation

     uart_tx_8n1 uart_transmitter (
       .clk(clk_9600),
       .txbyte(sensor_data),
       .senddata(trigger_send),
       .tx(uart_tx)
     );



- `txbyte(sensor_data)`: Sends the sensor data through UART.
+ `trigger_send`: A signal that initiates the transmission when the sensor data is ready.

### Clock Division for UART Baud Rate

     always @(posedge hw_clk) begin
       // Logic to generate a 9600 Hz clock for UART transmission
     end

- This section ensures that the clock frequency is suitable for UART communication.

## **`uart_tx_8n1.v`** (UART Transmission Logic)

This module implements the UART transmission protocol, specifically the 8N1 format.

### State Machine Definition

    parameter STATE_IDLE=8'd0;
    parameter STATE_STARTTX=8'd1;
    parameter STATE_TXING=8'd2;
    parameter STATE_TXDONE=8'd3;

- The state machine consists of four states to manage the transmission process.

### Transmission Control Logic

    always @ (posedge clk) begin
      if (senddata == 1 && state == STATE_IDLE) begin
        state <= STATE_STARTTX;
        buf_tx <= txbyte;
        txdone <= 1'b0;
      end
      else if (state == STATE_IDLE) begin
        txbit <= 1'b1; // Idle state is high
        txdone <= 1'b0;
      end
    

 - The system transitions to STATE_STARTTX when data is ready to be sent.

### Sending the Start Bit

    if (state == STATE_STARTTX) begin
      txbit <= 1'b0; // Start bit is low
      state <= STATE_TXING;
    end

- The start bit is transmitted first

### Data Bit Transmission

    if (state == STATE_TXING && bits_sent < 8'd8) begin
      txbit <= buf_tx[0]; // Send the least significant bit
      buf_tx <= buf_tx >> 1; // Shift the buffer
      bits_sent = bits_sent + 1;
    end

- Each Data Bit is sent sequentially

### Stop Bit and State Reset

    else if (state == STATE_TXING) begin
      txbit <= 1'b1; // Stop bit is high
      bits_sent <= 8'b0;
      state <= STATE_TXDONE;
     end
    if (state == STATE_TXDONE) begin
      txdone <= 1'b1; // Transmission complete
      state <= STATE_IDLE; // Return to idle state
    end
